In order to study the acoustic properties of the vocal tract, it is useful to perform acoustic
modelling. In most of the physical models used in speech and singing study, the frequency
range is limited from 0 kHz to about 5 kHz. This limited frequency range which does not cover
the entire range of perception of the human ear is often used because it is sucient to ensure
speech recognition and it allows one to use very simple acoustic models. In particular, one can
assume that plane waves are travelling inside the vocal tract, which means that the acoustic
pressure varies only along the propagation direction and depends only on the area of the
cross-sections of the vocal tract [1][4]. Thus, in this case a one-dimensional description with
an area function of the vocal tract shape is sucient. This allows one to perform simulations
at a very low computational cost: it is possible to perform real time simulations [5]. However,
given the limited frequency range used, the quality of the simulations and synthesis is not
optimal.
